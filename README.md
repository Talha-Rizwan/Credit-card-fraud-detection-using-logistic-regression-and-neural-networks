# Credit-card-fraud-detection-using-logistic-regression-and-neural-networks

In this project, we are going to use the credit card history dataset from the kaggle website. he problem is actually to detect the defaulter. Criminals use certain typical practices which help us detect them. Like in this case, if someone is using his own credit card, then he’ll be using it in a certain pattern (same way as used in past). But if someone steal it, then the transaction pattern changes a lot because of the reason that the thief will definitely try to make as much transactions as possible before it gets blocked. This change in transaction behaviour will help the credit card fraud detection model to predict that it is very much possible that the card is not in the owner’s hand, so the credit card company will get notified about this mysterious behaviour and the card will be temporarily suspended until confirmation.
